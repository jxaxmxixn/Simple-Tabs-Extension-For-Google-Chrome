# Simple-Tabs-Extension-For-Google-Chrome

This Google Chrome Extension was created for people who like to open a million tabs and have no idea why or how to make sense of them all.

With the click of the Simple Tabs icon, or using a hotkey (like Ctrl+S) your tabs quickly appear in a fully readable and usable format.

You can quickly rearange, duplicate, close, reload, pin, and mute, one or more tabs at the same time - or simply double click to go to that tab.

To install...

1. Download all files to a new directory on your computer
2. Open Google Chrome and navagate to chrome://extensions/ 
3. Check the "Developer mode" checkbox (if it's not already)
4. Click the "Load unpacked extension..." button and select the folder containing all the files.

Enjoy!
