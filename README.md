# Simple Tabs Extension For Google Chrome

**This Google Chrome Extension was created for people who like to open a million tabs and "mysteriously" have a hard time making sense of them all.**

With the click of the Simple Tabs icon, or using a hotkey (like Alt+S) your tabs quickly appear in a fully readable and usable format.

You can quickly rearange, duplicate, close, reload, pin, and mute, one or more tabs at the same time - or simply double click to go to that tab.

**To install...**

1. Download all files to a new directory on your computer
2. Open Google Chrome and navagate to chrome://extensions/ 
3. Check the "Developer mode" checkbox (if it's not already)
4. Click the "Load unpacked extension..." button and select the folder containing all the files.

*Enjoy!*
